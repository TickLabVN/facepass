# Facepass

A FaceID login module for Linux.

## Why?

There's also a FaceID login module for Linux: [Howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy). However, Howdy is not actively maintained. Last release is on Sep 2, 2020 and many dependencies are deprecated. Howdy also cannot recognize spoofed faces. That's why I decided to create Facepass.
